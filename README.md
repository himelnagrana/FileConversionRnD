**FileConversionRnD**
=================

This tiny R&D project deals with converting file formats to and from variety of types. Some other  **``file``** related tasks are there too.

I have mainly used composer for managing the library dependencies.


----------

*The major topics covered are*:
-----------------------------
 - Generate **``gmail``** like avatars from name acronyms.
 - Convert **``doc``**, **``docx``**, **``xls``**, **``xlsx``**,  etc. document files to **``pdf``**
 - Merging multiple **``images``**, **``pdf``** to *single* **``pdf``** file.
 - Convert **``html``** to **``image``** files -- which actually works as taking screenshots
 - **``AngularJS droplet``** for drag and drop file upload.
 - **``MarkDown``** to **``pdf``** -- single and batch conversion.
